# Mitochondria segmentation

We got images from 5x5x5Âµm section taken from the CA1 hippocampus region of the brain, corresponding to a 1065x2048x1536 volume. 
The researchers have annotated mitochondria, so each image also got a corresponding mask image.
We will read these files into Python and use the TensorFlow package.


Aim: Train a network that can detect and segment mitochondira from the dataset
